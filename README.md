# 🏥 Surgery Status Board — MVP

_A React/next.js‑based dashboard for tracking surgical patient information and progress._

- ✅ Admin and Doctor access control
- ✅ Patient creation and management
- ✅ Real‑time search and lookup
- ✅ Live status updates and workflow charts
- ✅ Exportable summaries (planned in next sprint)
- ✅ Fully client‑side with Zustand as the source of truth
